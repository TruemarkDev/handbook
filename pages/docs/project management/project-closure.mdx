#### Action Items (Developer)
    1. Developers should create comprehensive technical documentation, including project setup, database structure, API details, deployment procedures, and credentials for production, staging, and development environments, as well as project hosting and domain information, tailored to the specific RBAC or ABAC requirements of each project (This documentation contents could vary depending upon the nature and complexity of projects).
    2. Developers should review the existing documentation from the relevant personnel and update it to include any changes or additions.
    3. Decide on the platform for hosting the technical documentation and transfer documentation to the chosen platform: platform includes Confluence, GitHub, or GitLab.
    4. The decision to choose the platform is taken by the CEO or CTO incase of internal projects and the client incase of client projects.
#### Action Items (Project Manager)
    1. The Project Manager should assess and prioritize project bugs and outstanding tasks, assign responsible team members, set deadlines, and communicate progress to stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the remaining work and any potential impact on project closure.
    2. The Project Manager should prepare a separate document specifically for the project closure report, review and finalize the report.

### Project Closure: Archiving, Access Revocation, Ownership Transfer, and Data Cleanup.
- JIRA or Trello project archived (optional) and revoke access to people if needed.
- Transfer admin roles of JIRA, Confluence etc.
- Archive Slack and revoke access to people if needed.
- Archive Github repo and revoke access to people if needed.
- Change ownerships for documents posted in google drive or other tools as such used in the project.
- Clear calendar events and group emails or email that might not be used (contractors).
#### Action Items
    1. If archiving is necessary:
        - Consult with the project team and stakeholders to confirm their agreement to archive the project.
        - Remove team members who are no longer necessary in JIRA or Trello, Slack, Confluence and gitlab or github before archiving.
        - Ensure that the project's data, issues, and related information are securely stored and accessible for future reference.
    2. Revoking Access:
        - Identify individuals who no longer require access to JIRA or Trello, Confluence, Slack and gitlab or github and associated resources. The individuals are: 
            - Project team members who have completed their tasks and are transitioning to other projects.
            - Stakeholders or external collaborators whose involvement in the project is no longer necessary.
            - Revoke access to the relevant tools (e.g., JIRA, Trello, Slack, GitHub, Confluence) as per the identified individuals.   
    3. All the members including project manager should not own any document related to the project and transfer the ownership to the CTO or CEO incase of internal project and to the client incase of client project.
    4. Clear any group emails that are no longer necessary and calendar events: standup meetings, grooming session meetings, sprint planning meetings or any other meetings that were scheduled in the ongoing project.

- Inform PeopleOps and Resource team about project end date after maintenance.
- FYI to people outside of the project either through e-mail or weekly all hands. 
#### Action Items
    1. Notify 3 months prior to project closure date so that stakeholders and resource team have sufficient time to review and provide their approval.
    2. The maintenance could take 2 to 3 weeks depending on the project’s complexity. Therefore, notify people ops and the resource team at least a few days before the maintenance phase ends to allow them to provide any support hours that might be required.
    3. Notify the people outside of the project either through an all hands meeting or email depending on everyone’s availability.

### Hand over any equipment and materials (if any).
