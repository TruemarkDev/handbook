# Truemark Employee Handbook

Truemark Technology (Registered: Truemark Private Limited) is a remote first, quality focused company that helps entrepreneurs around the world build quality and impactful technology based solutions.

## We want Truemark to be a dream workplace for engineers.

Our workplace should be pleasant and supportive and our engineers should take pride in:

1. Building solutions that are down to the last detail, have pleasant UI and Intuitive UX.
2. Help clients validate their ideas as early as possible.

This Handbook provides an overview of why we exist, our roles, our investment into staff welfare, our team norms, Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC) guides, and details of our processes, policies and benefits.

If you’re reading this just after joining the company, it’s particularly on you, actually. It’s harder for us slowly-boiled frogs who’ve been with Truemark for a while to spot the broken ways. Please take advantage of that glorious, shiny ignorance of being new, and question things.

If you're a visitor and want to use them, feel free to use them anywhere, but we'd appreciate that you linked us back in appreciation.

## Contributing to our Handbook

We're a company that loves to improve our process continuously, so we're going to need everyone to help us keep this up to date.
