# Public Holidays
Truemark has 5 days a week(Monday to Friday) work policy and we only remain closed on selective public holidays as listed below:

## Leaves
| Type of Leaves | Non-working / Number of Days |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Sick | 7 |
| Annual | 12 |
| Bereavement | 3 |
| Maternity | ?? (yet to research) |
| Compensation (when you work on weekends for project success) | Saturday, Sunday or both |

Benefits such as the leave policy exist at Truemark to support the needs of our employees during moments that matter the most by offering paid time off or PTO as an often used abbreviation, that enhance productivity through the lens of inclusion. And when they are ready both mentally and physically after their planned and personal time off, they can focus on rolling out new features without the exhaustion or fear of approaching deadline.

* **Sick Leaves** – We strongly believe in having a policy that supports employees health where you get the time off you deserve to recover without having to think about the loss of pay. We facilitate our employees with 7 such paid sick leaves. However, any sick leaves taken after the available days will be considered a non-paid leave and a certain amount will be deducted from the salary. 

* **Annual Leaves** – 

## How long are you taking?

We trust you'll use your best judgement when taking holidays but in case you want some guidance on the kind of notice we expect when you take your holiday:

* **Less than 1 week** – We recommend giving at least 2 weeks notice for a 1 day off and closer to 4 weeks notice for more
* **Between 1 and 2 weeks** – We recommend giving at least 4 weeks notice for this kind of holiday, ideally more.
* **Greater than 3 weeks** – Please try to provide at least three months notice, so we can prepare for your absence.

If you wish to book holiday outside of these guidelines, please raise this request with your line manager, the ops team or the people team who will help you plan for longer time off.

## How will it affect your team?

Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. Try to forward-plan your holiday, so it doesn't have a detrimental affect on your team members or on the company.

We recommend you check with your Delivery Lead whenever you join a new team. Our general guideline on this is that only 1 person from a small team (less than 4) may be away at any one time. For larger teams (5+) please refer to your Delivery or Team Lead to confirm what works best for your team. 

## Who approves holiday?

We want to ensure teams own their holidays and that includes thinking about the commercial impact of taking them. To that affect we need to make sure you've done the following before booking holiday:

* Ask your team members if it's okay with them
* Ask your customers if it's okay with them
* Ensure your responsibilities are covered whilst you're away
* Ensure that the holiday is placed into our Hr Platform "Byzkit"
* Ask your line manager, the ops or people team only if you wish to book holiday outside of the guidelines

## Additional considerations

* We use the calendar when working out project allocation and the number of days being billed to customers, so it's important that it is always up-to-date and accurate.

* Time off due to illness and/or injury are handled separately. Flexible holiday cannot be used for these types of absences.

* If a team members performance declines significantly due to abuse of this policy, then we reserve the right to review their use of this policy.
