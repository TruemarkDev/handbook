Benefits such as the leave policy exist at Truemark to support the needs of our employees during moments that matter the most by offering Paid Time Off (PTO), that enhance productivity through the lens of inclusion. And when they are ready both mentally and physically after their planned and personal time off, they can focus on rolling out new features without the exhaustion or fear of approaching deadline.

**_Note_**:

Only compensation leaves are carried over to next working year if not taken within a particular yeat, all other leaves will reset on a yearly basis.

### Sick Leaves

We strongly believe in having a policy that supports employees health where you get the time off you deserve to recover without having to think about the loss of pay. 

We facilitate our employees with 7 days of such paid sick leaves. 

Sick leaves taken after the available days will be considered non-paid leaves and a certain amount will be deducted from the salary.

After your sick leave is approved you need to update your Slack status with the emoji ü§í and appropriate text along with the date until you will be unavailable for, before you set yourself away. E.g. Sick ü§í

### Annual Leaves

Annual leaves are called upon when the employee needs some time off work to recharge themselves, entitle themselves with a vacation or simply just to relax. Time constraints while working 9 to 6 make employees miss out the life that is happening outside their workspace. Rejuvenation is crucial for employees on all levels and allows them to bounce back with a boost in productivity. 

With all this in mind, we offer our employees with 12 days of time off work to finally step a break on those Slack messages, work-related emails and project deadlines.

Once you are all set to go on that vacation you have been planning for days or even weeks, we would like you to keep up that excitement and update your slack status with the appropriate emoji and text. For e.g. if you are planning to go for trekking you could add a trekking boot emoji ü•æ and appropriate text along with the date until you will be unavailable for. Examples:

- On a Trek ü•æ
- On a Vacation üèñÔ∏è

### Bereavement Leaves

The loss of a family member is an emotionally distressing time, and people may not be in the right frame of mind to cope with their task at hand and other professional commitments. 

We have a policy to offer 3 days of bereavement leave as we do understand the necessity of showing compassion with an enlightened approach to create a positive work culture where our employees know they are respected and valued.

When on a bereavement leave, please don't forget to update your Slack status with: "Away for Personal Reasons üí¨"

### Maternity Leaves

We realise that one of the most life changing events in an individual's life is the birth of a child. Our maternal leave policy has an extended fully paid maternal leave of total 3 months, available before, during or after your child's birth.

When on a maternity leave, please don't forget to update your Slack status with: "Away for Personal Reasons üí¨"

### Compensation Leaves

Employees who plan to work on weekends or a holiday due to the priority of the deliverables to ensure project success, our company offers them a compensatory off on any other workday to acknowledge their hard work. The compensatory leave is flexible as per the over time an employee has worked. However, if an employee still continues to work on weekends even after the project success is ensured then our company forces them to take a well deserved rest.

## How long are you taking?

We trust you'll use your best judgement when taking holidays so that projects are not hampered due to your absence but in case you want some guidance on the kind of notice we expect when you take your holiday:

- 1 day - We recommend giving at least 1 week notice unless it is urgent.
- 2 days - We recommend giving at least 2 week notice.
- Less than 1 week ‚Äì We recommend giving at least 4 weeks notice for more more than 2 days.
- Between 1 and 2 weeks ‚Äì We recommend giving at least 2 months of notice for this kind of holiday, so we can prepare for your absence.

## How will it affect your team?

Having several team members away at the same time can make life really difficult for everyone else. You should always forward-plan your holiday, so it doesn't have a detrimental affect on your team members or on the company.

Our general guideline on this is that only 1 person from a small team (less than 4) may be away at any one time. For larger teams (5+) please refer to your PM or Team Lead to confirm what works best for your team. 

## Who approves holiday?

We want to ensure teams own their holidays and that includes thinking about the commercial impact of taking them. To that affect we need to make sure you've done the following before booking a holiday.

### Regular employees

- Ask your PM and Team Lead if it's okay with them
- Ask your team members if it's okay with them.

### Team Leads and PMs

- Ask the Senior Management if it's okay for you to be on a leave.
- Ask your customers if it's okay with them.

### Applies to all

- Ensure your responsibilities are covered whilst you're away.
- Ask the Senior Management through your Team Lead or PM only if you wish to book holiday outside of the guidelines.

## Things to consider once the leave is approved

Well now that your leave has been approved, you need to make sure of the following things before you are away from your keyboard:

- Notify about your leave in the related Slack project channel
- Update your Slack status with appropriate emoji, text and the date you are on leave.

These things should be done so that your team mates are better informed about your unavailability and wouldn't mistakenly wait for you to reply to their messages which in turn helps manage expectations of everyone.
