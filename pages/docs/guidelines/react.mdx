# ReactJS Standard Packages

These are the standard packages we use daily at Truemark Technology and for every react project, we are working on. So, being familiar with these packages might help developers with efficient development.

TODO: We plan to get insights into different packages used for ReactJS development and how to install those to our projects.

## Design

While working on any front-end project at Truemark, you will use bootstrap for design purposes. Bootstrap covers a wide range of CSS properties and helps from laying out the design to providing margin and padding to elements.

We can install bootstrap's library from npm or yarn to our projects. So, feel free to install using any medium.

Installing bootstrap using `npm`

```
npm install bootstrap
```

Installing bootstrap using `yarn`

```
yarn add bootstrap
```

Find the npm package and github link below:
