# Folder Structure Guidelines

Folder structure we use in Truemark per programming language.

## ReactJS

1. Name of root folders should be in camelCase

![camelCase](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/camelcase.png 'Camel Case')
    
2. Name of files and folders inside `src/components`, `src/containers`, `src/pages` should be in PascalCase.

![Components](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/components.png 'Components')

![Containers](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/containers.png 'Containers')

![Pages](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/pages.png 'Pages')

3. Name of other files and folders (components, containers, pages excluded) should be in camelCase.

![Files](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/camelcase-files.png 'Files')
    
### Git commit Rules

Git commit rules should follow following structure:

[PC-NUM] / [TASK TITLE]
* Task description
- Task 1 done
- Fix task 2

![GitCommitRule](../../../images/guidelines/folder-structure/react-js/git-commit-rule.png 'Git Commit Rule')

Here “TEC” is project code (Abbreviated for Truemark E-commerce), “25” is the card number (from jira or trello) for the current task and “checkout-flow-page” is task name in short.
As a whole “TEC-25/checkout-flow-page” becomes a branch name.
