# Blogging Guidelines

This styleguide should be followed by all the bloggers who are writing for Truemark Technology.

This styleguide will also act as guideline if you are writing for our clients. This guideline doesn't apply to Self Promotion, Sponsored Post, and Ghost post section.

## Grammar, Punctuation, and Capitalization

**Length:** The minimum length of the article should be at least 800 words.

**Passive and Active Voice:** Active voice is mostly preferred while writing a blog. If possible, the use of passive voice should be avoided. Article with 10% of passive voice is considered best. Lesser the passive voice, better the article. But, if passive voice beats the active alternative, by all means: use it! Don’t make the mistake of following the rule of thumb too strictly.

**Sentence:** Sentence should be easy to understand and as short as possible. An article should contain transition words as much as possible. A maximum of 4 sentences in a paragraph is preferred.

**Words:** The words should be simple. It should easily be understood by the readers.

**Transition Words:** Transition words like but, however, and, since, furthermore, etc. make it easier for users to read and understand the content. Such words helps connect sentences and paragraphs, showing the relationships between them. Moreover, it improves the flow of the content. 

**Hook(s):** Hook is written at the beginning of your content to draw the attention of the readers, making them more curious about the topic. For more information on hooks, read this: https://www.academicwritingsuccess.com/7-sensational-essay-hooks/

**Acronyms:** We’re programmers and developers. Acronyms are part of our vocabulary. However, while some acronyms may seem like a term that should be known to most readers, we don’t want to exclude anyone from the conversation because they don’t understand. The first time you use an acronym, write out the full term and then put the acronym in parentheses. After you have done this once, you can use the acronym for the rest of the article. Example: Combined Programming Language (CPL).

**Apostrophes:** Avoid using apostrophes in plurals. (URLs, Smartphones, FAQs, etc.)

**Commas:** We’re an Oxford comma organization. In a set of three items, add the second comma before and/or.

**Company and Product Name:** Always capitalize and punctuate a company or product name exactly as the company does in their own materials.

**Ellipses:** Use sparingly.

**Em Dashes:** We use em dashes (the long ones), not en dashes (also used as hyphens). When breaking up clauses and phrases, use an em dash with no spaces around it. Example: “By applying Soft Skills to your programming career you will advance—I guarantee it.”

**Exclamation Points:** Exclamation points should be used when you are exclaiming something—meaning that you are either speaking to the reader directly or you are VERY excited about a statement. They should also be used sparingly (no more than one for every other paragraph) and only once. (You can relay your emotions about your content like this! But never like this!!!)

**Filenames and Extensions:** Always use the commonly accepted filenames for extensions, even if they are abbreviations. (JPG, GIF, PDF, etc.)—you do not have to spell them out (this is an exception to the acronym rule).

**Numbers:** Spell out cardinal numbers (one through nine) and use numerals for 10 and above. Never start a sentence with a numeral. In titles, use numerals always (even if under 10).

**Periods:** One space after punctuation at the end of a sentence, not two. Our editors will be very feisty if they have to delete spaces throughout an article. So just don’t!

**Truemark Technology:** Always use this capitalization for the site, products, etc.

**Soft Skills:** Always use this capitalization when referring to the book. When referring to the concept of soft skills, use lower-case.

**Spaces after Punctuation:** After all punctuation, primarily periods, there is to be only one space, never two.

**Time:** Use cardinal numbers and am or pm to indicate time. Use “noon” to indicate 12 pm.

**Titles:** Capitalize any word over four letters long (Exception: How To)

## Style and Voice

While articles are long (at least 1K words, preferably between 2-3K words), they need to be written in a way that is easily scannable for the internet audience.

- Break up long paragraphs into shorter paragraphs. Most should be 3-4 sentences long. There should be lots of white space.
- Use headings between transitions and topics, but avoid general ones like “Introduction” and “Conclusion”.
- Utilize style types like bold, italics, strikethroughs, and block quotes to call attention (but do so sparingly –– our editors will revert to plain-text if it is too much).
- Always defer to good quality writing, but use bullets and lists when applicable to help organize content for ease in reading.

When you are referring to your opinion (or a stated opinion of the site) use I, my, our, etc. When writing to the reader directly, address them as a person, not as an entity, by using you, your, etc. 

Additionally, the voice/tone is vitally important. While we do occasionally dish out tough love on the site, our articles should always inspire and motivate our readers to take action today to improve their lives, both professionally and personally. You should keep these adjectives and phrases in mind when writing your articles:

- Helpful
- Encouraging
- Passionate
- Motivated
- Persistent
- Possibility
- Encouragement
- Community
- Making the complex simple
- Shortcuts to a better future

Finally, posts should avoid unnatural call-to-actions. So, anything that explicitly prompts readers to buy, comment, hire, pay, etc. should be avoided at any part of the post. 

## Formatting

### SEO Information

- When your post is loaded into our editing process, you will see a new section at the top of the document requesting information for SEO purposes, including keywords, article synopsis, suggested resources, and notes for the editors/formatter.
- Fill this information in early and thoroughly, as it helps us get your post set up for publishing (and makes sure more people see it!).
- **Points to Focus**
  - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique.
    - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique. 
  - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique.
  - **Meta Description.** The meta description provides a short description of a webpage. It also appears on search engine results pages. The meta description should be about 160 characters long and should be able to make users click on it.
  - **Key phrases.** Key phrases are short descriptors that users type into search engines. The optimal length for a key phrase is up to four content words. Key phrase should appear in SEO title, in the meta description, in URL, at the beginning of your content. Keyphrase difficulty should be as low as possible.

### Headers

- Multiple levels of headings and titles can cause confusion by breaking up the structure of a piece in too many directions. Your reader’s attention will be drawn to the different styles rather than the content of your work.
- You should never use more than two levels of heading styles.
- Title style should be used for titles AND headings.
- Heading 1 should only be used if it is the only heading style. It should include a direct keyword or focus phrase that is “the one thing” that a reader should take away.
- Heading 2 & 3 should be used for multi-level structures, and preferably only in pieces that are over 750 words. Heading 2 should be the primary heading style for each section, and Heading 3 should be used as a sub-heading style to the relevant primary heading.

### Bold Font

- Use a bold font for a **strong** emphasis on a word, phrase, or sentence. This is often for something important you want the reader to remember specifically from that section. Like exclamation marks, this will often come across as yelling in your voice, so only use when that is what you are trying to do.

_Italics Font_

- Use an italics font for a _mild_ emphasis on a word, phrase, or sentence. Think of this the same way you speak — if you would speak with a slight inflection to drive a point, italics should be used.

Underline Font

- Since much of the copy and content is delivered digitally, avoid underlines in **all** situations, as they can be confused with hyperlinks in text

~~Strikethrough Font~~

- Should be used sparingly, usually to clarify something that has passed or a thought and/or word that you originally wanted to say, but instead chose something else.

### Lists

Lists make the content skimmable. Unless you are quickly listing items, bullet points and numbered lists should include both the main point and an explanation. Like so:

- **Main Point of the Bullet List:** And an explanation of what this point is exactly, and why it is relevant to either the section or piece as a whole.

Your bullet list should not have paragraph breaks within one bullet point. If your list contains multiple paragraphs, it should instead be formatted into subheadings.

While lists are good for online content, making it easier for readers to take in important points quickly, you should not use more than 2-3 in a piece. Unless it is a long piece with multiple lists of data or reference items.

### Links

- Links to books, resources, etc. should be naturally used throughout your articles.
- When linking to another site, link to an internal page, not the main page. If you are writing about a particular article or topic, link to that. If you are linking to the site in general, link to their About page.
- **Points to Focus**
  - **Inbound Links.** Inbound links are the links that are directed to your webpage from other webpages.
  - **Outbound Links.** Outbound links are the links that are directed to other webpages from your webpage.

## Images

Images are the supporting tool that can make your content from plain to attracting. If you have any ideas or suggestions for images to use, please include them **AS ATTACHMENTS to the Trello card**.

If you have images to use in your article to illustrate a concept or provide an example (such a screenshots, flow charts, graphs, etc –– which we LOVE using), please include them on the Trello card. The images should be clear and if possible, at the highest resolution available. Links to Dropbox, Google Drive, or other hosted image sites are also acceptable, as long as permission is provided to the formatter.

## Code

As WordPress does not have the capabilities to consistently display code properly, please format any code you wish to include in your article through GitHub Gists and place the link where the code should be written in your article. Our formatter will embed the code into the published article from there. 

## Sources & Attribution

**ALWAYS** give credit where it is due. Not only by stating who or where you are getting your information from, but also by providing links so that our audience can learn more if they are interested.

## Sponsored Posts

To maintain integrity and impartiality of the site, content submitted may not be sponsored or endorsed by companies or products. Writers may not receive compensation from any companies or products for a post/review written. 

Those who are found in violation of this policy will have their posts removed and will be blacklisted from submitting future articles. 

Any posts that are primarily reviews of endorsements of particular products or services must contain the following disclaimer pasted at the bottom: 

*“Disclaimer: All views and opinions expressed in this post are those of the author based on his/her personal experience, and have not been endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise compensated by the companies or products mentioned therein.”*

## Ghostwritten Posts

- Ghostwritten posts are permitted, **provided that this is made clear** when the post is accepted, and the ghostwriter is a member of the same organization (we do NOT accept content from third party writers). 
- In the case of a post that is being either ghostwritten or collaboratively written, the following requirements must be met: 
    - The individual under whose name the post will be published provides written consent to us for editing and publishing to be made in their name.
    - The individual responsible for making edits and revisions to the piece can confirm their ability to and follow through responding to all edits and changes required in a timely fashion.   
- Should we later discover that a post was written, edited, or otherwise produced by another individual(s) not listed on the byline, and this was not made clear at the outset, the post may be taken down and/or you will no longer be permitted to publish posts. 

## Self-Promotion & Republishing

### Self-Promotion

- You may find that in your article it naturally makes sense to link to your own content on your personal websites or the like. Including one or two of these links is fine, as long as, you are not explicitly encouraging readers to buy, share, promote, etc. You will also have a place in your author bio to link to any personal websites or businesses that you may have. Posts will be published with the author as an individual, and not a company. 
- If you aren’t sure if your link is appropriate, just ask! 

### Republishing

- You are free to republish articles after a couple weeks on your own site if you would like to keep the content associated with your own name and work. 
- When doing so, please include an attribution, or a sentence at the end of a post saying "This post originally appeared on ... " with a nofollow link. That helps Google understand that it isn't duplicate content, but a republished piece. 
    - Example: "This post originally appeared on `<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.xyz.com/myarticleURL">xyz.com</a>`"

## Article Length

Different types of post length are:

1. Short: 300-400 words
2. Medium: 600-1250 words
3. Long: 1800-2500 words

- 300-600 words: The standard blogging length, recommended by many "expert" bloggers. Good middle-ground for social shares and comments. Too short to gain much authority or search engine-love.
- 750 words: This is the standard length for professional journalism, especially newspapers. I find that it's pretty good for getting links from other bloggers and shares on social media.
- 1000-1500 words: You'll get fewer comments at this length but a lot more shares on social media, especially if you've followed the advice above and written a post that actually solves someone's problem. That being said, I've written posts this long and gotten 100+ comments, so it really depends on the topic and your audience.
- 2450 words: The highest-ranking articles on Google are most often 2,450 words. If you want to rank well on search engines (and thus get thousands of new readers per month), this is the best length to write. However, make sure you write about a topic that people are actually searching for. It would be a shame to write a book-length blog post on a topic no one ever searches for!
