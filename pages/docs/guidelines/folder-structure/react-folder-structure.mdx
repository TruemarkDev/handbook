Git commit Rules:
Git commit rules should follow following structure:

[PC-NUM] / [TASK TITLE]
* Task description
Task 1 done
Fix task 2


Here “TEC” is project code (Abbreviated for Truemark E-commerce), “25” is the card number (from jira or trello) for the current task and “checkout-flow-page” is task name in short.
As a whole “TEC-25/checkout-flow-page” becomes a branch name
