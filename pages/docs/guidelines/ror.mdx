#### Figaro

Figaro allows simple, heroku-friendly rails app `configuration` using ENV and a single YAML file. It was written to make it easy to securely configure rails applications since configuration values often include sensitive information. Figaro strives to be secure by default by encouraging a convention that keeps configuration out of git. But there isn't just figaro which offers a secure way to store configuation data but a custom yml file in combination with Rails 4.2 feature [config_for](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/the-lesser-known-features-in-rails-4-dot-2//) also offers nearly the same benefits.

While `config_for` tends to be a more simple solution than adding an additional dependency since it is a built-in rails feature but figaro has much more to offer. It has a `require_keys` method to raise an error during initialization in case you haven't specified the required configuration values. With figaro one can keep more flexibilty to change the configuration implementation based on environment variables.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the figaro gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` figaro

```
gem install figaro
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'figaro', '~> 1.2'
```

It allows for real-time features to be written in ruby in the same style and form as the rest of our application, while still being performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework.

<br />

#### Redis

Redis is a ruby client that tries to match Redis' API one-to-one, while still providing an idiomatic interface. Redis is an `in-memory` data structure store used to help building high-performance and scalable web applications, similar to [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but with two main differences:

- Redis can persist data to disk, making it a kind of NoSQL database, so data won't disappear when restarting the server.
- Redis can store more data types besides strings, such as Hashes, Lists, Sets and Sorted Sets.

The persistence capability is intriguing, however if there is a power outage and Redis didn't have time to persist the latest data, some applications may be impacted. Another intriguing aspect is that it may append each command to a log in these circumstances.

Redis may therefore apply all the commands across the data to return to the most recent state in the event of a failure after resuming. Redis can be used as a message-queue broker, database, or `caching` system. In a server group, it can also be used with primary-secondary asynchronous replication.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the redis-rb gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` redis-rb

```
gem install redis
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'redis', '~> 5.0', '>= 5.0.5'
```

The aforementioned redis-rb version is subject to change so please find the official redis-rb gem and github link below for latest version:

#### Active Model Serializers

ActiveModel::Serializers allows you to generate your JSON in an object-oriented and convention-driven manner which brings convention over configuration to your JSON generation. It works through two components: serializers and adapters. Serializers describe which attributes and relationships should be serialized while adapters describe how attributes and relationships should be serialized. The easiest way to create a new serializer is to generate a new resource, which will generate a serializer at the same time.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the active_model_serializers gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` active_model_serializers

```
gem install active_model_serializers

#### Pg

Pg is the Ruby interface to the `PostgreSQL` RDBMS client library. It works with PostgreSQL 9.3 and later.

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over decades of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the pg gem in the gemfile.

#### MySQL2

The Mysql2 gem is a modern, simple & fast Mysql library for Ruby which is meant to serve the extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating on results. Some database libraries available out there serve as direct one-on-one mappings of the already complex C APIs available while this one is not. It also forces the use of UTF-8 (or binary) for the connection and uses encoding-aware MySQL API calls where it can.

Mysql2 links against MySQL's `libmysqlclient` library or `Connector/C` library, and compatible alternatives such as `MariaDB`. So, you may need to install a package such as `libmariadb-dev`, `libmysqlclient-dev`, `mysql-devel`, or other appropriate package for your system. For system-specific instructions, you may need to visit the official documentation link given below.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the mysql2 gem in the gemfile.
