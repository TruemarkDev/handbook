# Ruby on Rails

## Standard Gems

Here, we plan to get insights into different gems used for Ruby on Rails application development phase, testing phase and the staging/production environment along with the installation process to add those gems into our projects.

### Development

#### CanCanCan

CanCanCan is a simple authorization solution for Rails which puts a constraint on what resources a given user is allowed to access. The permissions can be defined in one or multiple ability files and is not duplicated across controllers, views, and database queries, keeping the permissions logic in one place for easy maintenance and testing.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the cancancan gem in the gemfile.

#### Environment Variables Manager

##### Figaro

Figaro strives to keep API keys, environment variables and other configurations off your git repositories in a fairly easy to accomplish manner. It was written to make it easy to securely configure rails applications since configuration values often include sensitive information. With figaro one can keep more flexibilty to change the configuration implementation based on environment variables.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the figaro gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` figaro

```

Github: [figaro docs](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)

Rubygems: [figaro gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/figaro)

<br />

##### Config_for

There isn't just figaro which offers a secure way to store `configuation data` but a custom yml file in combination with Rails 4.2 feature `config_for` also offers nearly the same benefits. Even though figaro offers the benefits that are far more lucrative but it still is an additional dependency while config_for is a built-in rails feature which tends to be a more simple solution than adding an extra gem dependency.

To find more about the feature usage please visit the link to the configuration guide given below:

Configuration Guide: [config_for](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/the-lesser-known-features-in-rails-4-dot-2/)

<br />

##### Rails Credentials

Rails yet another built-in feature offers a way to store api keys and secrets in an encrypted file which cannot be edited directly. Rails uses `config/master.key` or alternatively looks for the environment variable `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` to encrypt the credentials file. Because the credentials file is encrypted, it can be stored in version control, as long as the master key is kept safe. By default, the credentials file contains the application's secret_key_base. It can also be used to store other secrets such as access keys for external APIs.

To find more about the feature usage please visit the official rails guide given below:

Rails Guide: [rails_credentials](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)

<br />

#### Pry-byebug

Pry-byebug gem adds step-by-step `debugging` and stack navigation capabilities to [pry](https://pry.github.io/) using [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug). While pry aims to be more than an IRB replacement and can be invoked in the middle of a running program to open a Pry session which can then be used to debug, implement developer consoles or apply hot patches, byebug offers a more simple to use and feature rich debugging. Byebug uses the TracePoint API for execution control and the Debug Inspector API for call stack navigation.

To use pry-byebug, one needs to invoke pry normally and there is no need to start your script or app differently. Execution will stop in the first statement after your `binding.pry`. It also adds 'step', 'next', 'finish', 'continue' and 'break' commands to control execution.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the pry-byebug gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` pry-byebug

```
gem install pry-byebug
```

#### Pronto

Pronto runs analysis quickly by checking only the relevant changes. Although designed for use with GitHub `pull requests`, it also functions locally and has integrations with GitLab and Bitbucket. It is a perfect gem if you want to find out quickly if a branch brings changes that follow your style guide, are DRY, don't introduce security issues and more. While pronto runs the checks on a diff between the current HEAD and the provided commit (with master being the default), pronto-rubocop (also a ruby code analyzer) is a pronto runner for [RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) that ensures the committed code abides by the set of rules defined by rubocop.

<br />

##### MySQL2

The Mysql2 gem is a modern, simple & fast Mysql library for Ruby which is meant to serve the extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating on results. Some database libraries available out there serve as direct one-on-one mappings of the already complex C APIs available while this one is not. It also forces the use of UTF-8 (or binary) for the connection and uses encoding-aware MySQL API calls where it can.

Mysql2 links against MySQL's `libmysqlclient` library or `Connector/C` library, and compatible alternatives such as `MariaDB`. So, you may need to install a package such as `libmariadb-dev`, `libmysqlclient-dev`, `mysql-devel`, or other appropriate package for your system. For system-specific instructions, you may need to visit the Github link given below.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the mysql2 gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` mysql2

```
gem install mysql2
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'mysql2', '~> 0.5.4'
```

<br />

#### Redis

Redis is a ruby client that tries to match Redis' API one-to-one, while still providing an idiomatic interface. Redis is an `in-memory` data structure store used to help building high-performance and scalable web applications, similar to [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but with two main differences:

- Redis can persist data to disk, making it a kind of NoSQL database, so data won't disappear when restarting the server.
- Redis can store more data types besides strings, such as Hashes, Lists, Sets and Sorted Sets.

The persistence capability is intriguing, however if there is a power outage and Redis didn't have time to persist the latest data, some applications may be impacted. Another intriguing aspect is that it may append each command to a log in these circumstances.

Redis may therefore apply all the commands across the data to return to the most recent state in the event of a failure after resuming. Redis can be used as a message-queue broker, database, or `caching` system. In a server group, it can also be used with primary-secondary asynchronous replication.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the redis-rb gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` redis-rb

```
gem install redis
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'redis', '~> 5.0', '>= 5.0.5'
```
