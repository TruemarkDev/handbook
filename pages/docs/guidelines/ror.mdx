# Ruby on Rails

## Standard Gems

Here, we plan to get insights into different gems used for Ruby on Rails application development phase, testing phase and the staging/production environment along with the installation process to add those gems into our projects.

### Development

#### RuboCop

RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer (a.k.a. `linter`) and code formatting tool. It aims to enforce the community-driven guidelines outlined in [Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/). It is extremely flexible and most aspects of its behavior can be tweaked via various configuration options. In practice RuboCop offers pretty much a lot of reasonable features on top of what you'd normally expect from a linter:

- Autocorrection of many of the code offenses it detects and robust code formatting capabilities.
- Multiple result formatters for both interactive use and for feeding data into other tools.
- Ability to have different configuration for different parts of your codebase.
- Ability to disable certain cops only for specific files or parts of files.
- It's easy to extend RuboCop with custom cops and formatters.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the rubocop gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` rubocop

```
gem install rubocop
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'rubocop', '~> 1.40'
```

#### Roo

Roo provides an interface to various `spreadsheet` files. It implements read access for all common spreadsheet types and is capable to handle: Excel 2007 - 2013 formats (xlsx, xlsm), LibreOffice / OpenOffice.org formats (ods), CSV, Excel 97, Excel 2002 XML, and Excel 2003 XML formats when using the roo-xls gem (xls, xml) and Google spreadsheets with read/write access when using roo-google. Roo has the ability to export sheets using the formats such as sheet.to_csv, sheet.to_matrix, sheet.to_xml and sheet.to_yaml. However, it will only export the `default_sheet`.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the roo gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` roo

```
gem install roo
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

#### Overcommit

Overcommit is a fully configurable and extendable utility to manage `Git hooks`. In addition to supporting a wide variety of hooks that can be used across multiple repositories, one can also define hooks specific to a repository which are stored in source control. You can also easily [add your existing hook scripts](https://github.com/sds/overcommit#adding-existing-git-hooks) without having to write any Ruby code. You can run the same set of hooks that would be executed in a pre-commit hook against your entire repository by running `overcommit --run`. This makes it easy to have the checks verified by a CI service such as [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/), including custom hooks that you have written yourself.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the overcommit gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` overcommit

```
gem install overcommit
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```

<br />

#### Pry-byebug

Pry-byebug gem adds step-by-step `debugging` and stack navigation capabilities to [pry](https://pry.github.io/) using [byebug](https://github.com/deivid-rodriguez/byebug). While pry aims to be more than an IRB replacement and can be invoked in the middle of a running program to open a Pry session which can then be used to debug, implement developer consoles or apply hot patches, byebug offers a more simple to use and feature rich debugging. Byebug uses the TracePoint API for execution control and the Debug Inspector API for call stack navigation.

To use pry-byebug, one needs to invoke pry normally and there is no need to start your script or app differently. Execution will stop in the first statement after your `binding.pry`. It also adds 'step', 'next', 'finish', 'continue' and 'break' commands to control execution.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the pry-byebug gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` pry-byebug

```
gem install pry-byebug

<br />

#### Mail

##### Letter Opener

Letter Opener is a gem that allows developers `preview email` in the default browser instead of sending it. This means you do not need to set up email delivery in your development environment, and you no longer need to worry about sending a test email to someone else's address accidentally. The messages are stored in `tmp/letter_opener`. If you want to change application that will be used to open your emails you have to override `LAUNCHY_APPLICATION` environment variable or set `Launchy.application` in the initializer.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the letter_opener gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` letter_opener

```
gem install letter_opener
```

<br />

### Testing

After a feature has been completed, it has to be documented and tested to ensure that the code works as expected for a behavior and use case. It always starts with writing a failing test case and then refactoring just enough code to pass the test.

<br />

#### Test objects

##### FactoryBot

FactoryBot is a fixtures replacement with a straightforward definition syntax, support for multiple `build strategies` such as saved & unsaved instances, attribute hashes, and `stubbed objects`, and support for multiple factories for the same class, including factory inheritance.

#### API Documentation

##### Rswag

Rswag creates swagger tooling and generates beautiful `API documentation` for Rails APIs, including a UI to explore and test operations, directly from your rspec integration tests. It extends rspec-rails "request specs" with a Swagger-based DSL for describing and testing API operations. You describe your API operations with a concise, intuitive syntax, and it automatically runs the tests. Once you have green tests, run a rake task to auto-generate corresponding Swagger files and expose them as YAML or JSON endpoints. Rswag also provides an embedded version of the awesome swagger-ui that's powered by the exposed file. This toolchain makes it seamless to go from integration specs, which you're probably doing in some form already, to living documentation for your API consumers.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the rswag gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` rswag

```

#### Others

##### Database Cleaner Adapter for ActiveRecord

Database Cleaner for ActiveRecord is a gem that contains strategies for `cleaning databases` using ActiveRecord. The use case of this gem is to ensure a clean state of database for `testing`. Each strategy is a small amount of code but is code that is usually needed in any ruby app that is testing with a database. For the SQL libraries, the fastest option will be to use `:transaction` as transactions can simply be rolled back. If you wind up needing to use multiple database connections in your tests (i.e. your tests run in a different process than your application) then using this strategy becomes a bit more difficult.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the database_cleaner-active_record gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` database_cleaner-active_record

```
gem install database_cleaner-active_record
```

<br />

##### WebMock

WebMock is a library that allows `stubbing` HTTP requests, setting and verifying expectations on HTTP requests in Ruby. It does a lot more than stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests such as:

- Matching requests based on method, URI, headers and body
- Smart matching of the same URIs in different representations (also encoded and non encoded forms)
- Smart matching of the same headers in different representations.
- Support for Test::Unit, RSpec and MiniTest

### Production

#### Whenever

Whenever is a Ruby gem that provides a clean ruby syntax for writing and deploying `cron jobs`. You can list installed cron jobs using `crontab -l`. Run `whenever --help` for a complete list of options for selecting the schedule to use, setting variables in the schedule, etc. Whenever ships with three pre-defined job types: command, runner, and rake. You can define your own with `job_type`.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the whenever gem in the gemfile.

<br />

#### PublicActivity

PublicActivity provides an easy `activity tracking` for your ActiveRecord models, Mongoid 3 and MongoMapper models in Rails 5.0+. To simply put, it records what has been changed or created and gives you the ability to present those recorded activities to users. By default public_activity uses Active Record and activities such as create, update and destroy are recorded in activities table. This is all you need to start recording activities for basic CRUD actions. You can also trigger custom activities by setting all your required parameters and triggering `create_activity` on the tracked model.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the public_activity gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` public_activity

```
gem install public_activity
```

<br />

#### AWS SDK

The official AWS SDK for Ruby which provides both resource oriented interfaces and API clients for `AWS services`. To set up aws-sdk you will need to configure credentials and a region, either in configuration files or environment variables, to avail API calls. It is recommended that you provide these via your environment. This makes it easier to rotate credentials and it keeps your secrets out of version control. You can also configure default credentials and the region via the `Aws.config` hash. The Aws.config hash takes precedence over environment variables.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the aws-sdk gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` aws-sdk

```
gem install aws-sdk
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'aws-sdk', '~> 3.1'
```

<br />

#### Active Model Serializers

ActiveModel::Serializers allows you to generate your JSON in an object-oriented and convention-driven manner which brings convention over configuration to your JSON generation. It works through two components: serializers and adapters. Serializers describe which attributes and relationships should be serialized while adapters describe how attributes and relationships should be serialized. The easiest way to create a new serializer is to generate a new resource, which will generate a serializer at the same time.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the active_model_serializers gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` active_model_serializers

```
gem install active_model_serializers
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

<br />

#### External API Calls

##### Rest Client

A simple HTTP and REST client for Ruby, inspired by the Sinatra microframework style of specifying get, put, post and delete actions in a REST web service. In the high level helpers, only POST, PATCH, and PUT take a payload argument. To pass a payload with other HTTP verbs or to pass more advanced options, use `RestClient::Request.execute` instead. The top level helper methods like `RestClient.get` accept a headers hash as their last argument and don't allow passing more complex options. But these helpers are just thin wrappers around `RestClient::Request.execute`.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the rest-client gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` rest-client

```
gem install rest-client
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'rest-client', '~> 2.1'
```

The aforementioned rest-client version is subject to change so please find the official rest-client gem and github link below for latest version:

Rubygems: [rest-client gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client)

<br />

##### Httparty

Httparty makes http fun again! There isn't a party like a httparty, because a httparty does not stop which makes querying and consuming `restful` web services extremely easy. It also includes the executable `httparty` which can be used to query web services and examine the resulting output. By default it will output the response as a pretty-printed Ruby object (to have a clear idea of the structure of output). This can also be overridden to output formatted XML or JSON. Execute `httparty --help` for all the options.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the httparty gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` httparty

```
gem install httparty
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'httparty', '~> 0.20.0'
```

#### Action Cable

Action Cable seamlessly integrates `WebSockets` with the rest of our rails application to structure many real-time application concerns into channels over a single websocket connection. It allows for real-time features to be written in ruby in the same style and form as the rest of our application, while still being performant and scalable. It's a full-stack offering that provides both a client-side JavaScript framework and a server-side Ruby framework. You have access to your entire domain model written with Active Record or your ORM of choice.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the actioncable gem in the gemfile.

<br />

#### Background Job

##### Sidekiq

Sidekiq is a full-featured and efficient `background job` framework for Ruby. It aims to be simple to integrate with any modern Rails application and provides much higher background processing performance than other existing solutions. It is designed for parallel execution so design your jobs so you can run those jobs in parallel. It has basic features for tuning concurrency (e.g. targeting a sidekiq process at a queue with a defined number of threads) but your system architecture is much simpler if you don't have such specialization. You can use a [connection pool](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Advanced-Options#concurrency) to limit the overall number of connections to a resource-limited server if your Sidekiq processes are overwhelming it with traffic.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the sidekiq gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` sidekiq

```
gem install sidekiq
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'sidekiq', '~> 7.0', '>= 7.0.2'
```

The aforementioned sidekiq version is subject to change so please find the official sidekiq gem and github link below for latest version:

Github: [sidekiq docs](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki)

Rubygems: [sidekiq gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq)

<br />

#### Environment Variables Manager

##### Figaro

Figaro strives to keep API keys, environment variables and other configurations off your git repositories in a fairly easy to accomplish manner. It was written to make it easy to securely configure rails applications since configuration values often include sensitive information. With figaro one can keep more flexibilty to change the configuration implementation based on environment variables.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the figaro gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` figaro

```
gem install figaro
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'figaro', '~> 1.2'
```

The aforementioned figaro version is subject to change so please find the official figaro gem and github link below for latest version:

Github: [figaro docs](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro)

Rubygems: [figaro gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/figaro)

<br />

##### Config_for

There isn't just figaro which offers a secure way to store `configuation data` but a custom yml file in combination with Rails 4.2 feature `config_for` also offers nearly the same benefits. Even though figaro offers the benefits that are far more lucrative but it still is an additional dependency while config_for is a built-in rails feature which tends to be a more simple solution than adding an extra gem dependency.

To find more about the feature usage please visit the link to the configuration guide given below:

Configuration Guide: [config_for](https://www.justinweiss.com/articles/the-lesser-known-features-in-rails-4-dot-2/)

<br />

##### Rails Credentials

Rails yet another built-in feature offers a way to store api keys and secrets in an encrypted file which cannot be edited directly. Rails uses `config/master.key` or alternatively looks for the environment variable `ENV["RAILS_MASTER_KEY"]` to encrypt the credentials file. Because the credentials file is encrypted, it can be stored in version control, as long as the master key is kept safe. By default, the credentials file contains the application's secret_key_base. It can also be used to store other secrets such as access keys for external APIs.

To find more about the feature usage please visit the official rails guide given below:

Rails Guide: [rails_credentials](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/security.html)

<br />

#### User Interface (UI)

##### Pagy

Pagy gem is an agnostic `pagination` in plain ruby. It supports all kinds of pagination, works in any environment, with any collection such as DB or ORM, supports all kinds of CSS Frameworks, supports faster client-side rendering and has 100% of test coverage for Ruby, HTML and JavaScript E2E. Moreover, it is very modular and does not load any unnecessary code in your app and works with fast helpers or easy to edit [templates](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/docs/how-to/#use-templates).
Here at Truemark, we prefer using pagy over kaminari because its efficiency amounts to hundreds of times more than Kaminari in normal UI conditions, and it should still be many tens of time more in API conditions even with minimal pagination information in the response.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the pagy gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` pagy

```
gem install pagy
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'pagy', '~> 5.10', '>= 5.10.1'
```

The aforementioned pagy version is subject to change so please find the official pagy gem and github link below for latest version:

Github: [pagy docs](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy)

Rubygems: [pagy gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/pagy)

<br />

##### Kaminari

Kaminari is a Scope & Engine based, clean, powerful, agnostic, customizable and sophisticated `paginator` for modern web app frameworks and ORMs. Everything in Kaminari is method chainable with less "Hasheritis". You know, that's the modern Rails way. No special collection class or anything for the paginated values, instead using a general AR::Relation instance. So, of course you can chain any other conditions before or after the paginator scope. Kaminari is an alternative to pagy and was extensively used here at Truemark before moving on with the benefits of pagy.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the kaminari gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` kaminari

```
gem install kaminari
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'kaminari', '~> 1.2', '>= 1.2.2'
```

The aforementioned kaminari version is subject to change so please find the official kaminari gem and github link below for latest version:

<br />

##### Font Awesome Rails

Font Awesome Rails provides the [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) web `fonts and stylesheets` as a Rails engine for use with the asset pipeline. When building a Rails engine that needs font-awesome-rails as a dependency, be sure to require "font-awesome-rails" somewhere during the initialization of your engine otherwise, rails won't automatically pick up the load path of the font-awesome-rails assets and helpers.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the font-awesome-rails gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` font-awesome-rails

```
gem install font-awesome-rails
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'font-awesome-rails', '~> 4.7', '>= 4.7.0.8'

##### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a rubygem for Rails, Sprockets, Hanami, etc. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. If you have just generated a new rails app, it may come with a `.css` file so ensure that the file has `.scss` extension (or `.sass` for Sass syntax). If `.css` file exists, it will be served instead of Sass, so you might want to rename it. Then, remove all the `*= require` and `*= require_tree` statements from the Sass file and use `@import` to import Sass files instead.

> Do not use `*= require` in Sass or your other stylesheets will not be able to access the Bootstrap mixins and variables.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the bootstrap gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` bootstrap

```
gem install bootstrap
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'bootstrap', '~> 5.2', '>= 5.2.3'
```

The aforementioned bootstrap version is subject to change so please find the official bootstrap gem and github link below for latest version:

##### Sass Rails

Sass Rails gem provides official integration for rails projects with the `Sass` stylesheet language. To configure Sass via Rails set `config.sass` in your application and/or environment files to set configuration properties that will be passed to Sass. When in Rails, there is a special import syntax that allows you to glob imports relative to the folder of the stylesheet that is doing the importing.

- `@import "mixins/*"` statement will import all the files in the mixins folder
- `@import "mixins/**/*"` statement will import all the files in the mixins tree

Any valid ruby glob may be used. The imports are sorted alphabetically.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the sass-rails gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` sass-rails

```
gem install sass-rails
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 6.0'
```

##### CKEditor

CKEditor is a community maintained WYSIWYG `text editor` designed to simplify and enhance web content creation. It brings common word processing features directly to our web pages. For file upload support, you must generate the necessary file storage models. The currently supported backends are: ActiveRecord (active_storage, paperclip, carrierwave, dragonfly) and Mongoid (paperclip, carrierwave, dragonfly). All ckeditor models will be generated in the `app/models/ckeditor` directory. Models are autoloaded in Rails 4 so for earlier rails versions, they are needed to be added to the autoload path (in application.rb).

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the ckeditor gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` ckeditor

```
gem install ckeditor
```

##### Liquid

Liquid is a secure, non-evaling end user `template engine` which was written with very specific requirements to produce an aesthetic markup with the requirements enlisted below:

- It has to produce good looking and simple markup.
- It needs to be non evaling and secure. Liquid templates are created such that users can edit them with a restraint to not allow users run any sort of insecure code on your server.
- It has to be stateless. Compile and render steps are separated so that the expensive parsing and compiling can be done once and later on you can just render it passing in a hash with local variables and objects which offer a way to render templates directly from the database.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the liquid gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` liquid

```
gem install liquid
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

##### MySQL2

The Mysql2 gem is a modern, simple & fast Mysql library for Ruby which is meant to serve the extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating on results. Some database libraries available out there serve as direct one-on-one mappings of the already complex C APIs available while this one is not. It also forces the use of UTF-8 (or binary) for the connection and uses encoding-aware MySQL API calls where it can.

Mysql2 links against MySQL's `libmysqlclient` library or `Connector/C` library, and compatible alternatives such as `MariaDB`. So, you may need to install a package such as `libmariadb-dev`, `libmysqlclient-dev`, `mysql-devel`, or other appropriate package for your system. For system-specific instructions, you may need to visit the Github link given below.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the mysql2 gem in the gemfile.

#### Redis

Redis is a ruby client that tries to match Redis' API one-to-one, while still providing an idiomatic interface. Redis is an `in-memory` data structure store used to help building high-performance and scalable web applications, similar to [Memcached](https://memcached.org/), but with two main differences:

- Redis can persist data to disk, making it a kind of NoSQL database, so data won't disappear when restarting the server.
- Redis can store more data types besides strings, such as Hashes, Lists, Sets and Sorted Sets.

The persistence capability is intriguing, however if there is a power outage and Redis didn't have time to persist the latest data, some applications may be impacted. Another intriguing aspect is that it may append each command to a log in these circumstances.

Redis may therefore apply all the commands across the data to return to the most recent state in the event of a failure after resuming. Redis can be used as a message-queue broker, database, or `caching` system. In a server group, it can also be used with primary-secondary asynchronous replication.

This gem can be added to any rails project by either executing the global install command or adding the redis-rb gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` redis-rb

```
gem install redis
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'redis', '~> 5.0', '>= 5.0.5'
