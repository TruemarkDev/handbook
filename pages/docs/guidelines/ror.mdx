# Ruby on Rails

## Standard Gems

Here, we plan to get insights into different gems used for Ruby on Rails application development phase, testing phase and user interface (UI) changes along with the installation process to add those gems into our projects.

### Development

While developing a rails application at Truemark, we place great emphasis on user authentication and authorization so we prefer using the following modules to ensure the preceding conditions are met.

#### Devise

Devise is a flexible authentication module for Rails with Warden. It is a rack based MVC solution composed of multiple modules which can be signed into or added to our projects based on the use cases.

Devise can be added to any project by either executing the global install command or adding the devise gem in the gemfile.

To `global install` devise

```
gem install devise
```

To add the module in the `gemfile`

```
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8', '>= 4.8.1'
```

The aforementioned devise version is subject to change so please find the official devise gem and github link below for latest version:
