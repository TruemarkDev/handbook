## Career Plan

We want everyone to feel included and we encourage every team member to contribute in their own way to Truemark. We want everyone to feel proud of their contribution to our common goal: to make Truemark a better place to work at, every day.

### T-Shaped People

We hire people we believe in. People who we think have a broad set of skills.

These are people who are both skilled at a broad set of valuable things but also experts at a specific aspect. We want excellent professionals but social skills are not less relevant. We value your capability to interact with other people, being able to work together, collaborate, deal with clients and be part of the team.

On top of this, all of us can be Project Managers as long as we want to. In fact, each new project gets a different PM depending on its specifications and scope.
