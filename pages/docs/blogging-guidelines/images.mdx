# Images
----

Images are the supporting tool that can make your content from plain to attracting. If you have any ideas or suggestions for images to use, please include them **AS ATTACHMENTS to the Trello card**.

If you have images to use in your article to illustrate a concept or provide an example (such a screenshots, flow charts, graphs, etc –– which we LOVE using), please include them on the Trello card. The images should be clear and if possible, at the highest resolution available. Links to Dropbox, Google Drive, or other hosted image sites are also acceptable, as long as permission is provided to the formatter.
