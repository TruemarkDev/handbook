# Ghostwritten Posts
----

- Ghostwritten posts are permitted, **provided that this is made clear** when the post is accepted, and the ghostwriter is a member of the same organization (we do NOT accept content from third party writers). 
- In the case of a post that is being either ghostwritten or collaboratively written, the following requirements must be met: 
    - The individual under whose name the post will be published provides written consent to us for editing and publishing to be made in their name.
    - The individual responsible for making edits and revisions to the piece can confirm their ability to and follow through responding to all edits and changes required in a timely fashion.   
- Should we later discover that a post was written, edited, or otherwise produced by another individual(s) not listed on the byline, and this was not made clear at the outset, the post may be taken down and/or you will no longer be permitted to publish posts.
