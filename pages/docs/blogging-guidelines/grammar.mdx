# Grammar, Punctuation, and Capitalization
----

**Length:** The minimum length of the article should be at least 800 words.

**Passive and Active Voice:** Active voice is mostly preferred while writing a blog. If possible, the use of passive voice should be avoided. Article with 10% of passive voice is considered best. Lesser the passive voice, better the article. But, if passive voice beats the active alternative, by all means: use it! Don’t make the mistake of following the rule of thumb too strictly.

**Sentence:** Sentence should be easy to understand and as short as possible. An article should contain transition words as much as possible. A maximum of 4 sentences in a paragraph is preferred.

**Words:** The words should be simple. It should easily be understood by the readers.

**Transition Words:** Transition words like but, however, and, since, furthermore, etc. make it easier for users to read and understand the content. Such words helps connect sentences and paragraphs, showing the relationships between them. Moreover, it improves the flow of the content. 

**Hook(s):** Hook is written at the beginning of your content to draw the attention of the readers, making them more curious about the topic. For more information on hooks, read this: https://www.academicwritingsuccess.com/7-sensational-essay-hooks/

**Acronyms:** We’re programmers and developers. Acronyms are part of our vocabulary. However, while some acronyms may seem like a term that should be known to most readers, we don’t want to exclude anyone from the conversation because they don’t understand. The first time you use an acronym, write out the full term and then put the acronym in parentheses. After you have done this once, you can use the acronym for the rest of the article. Example: Combined Programming Language (CPL).

**Apostrophes:** Avoid using apostrophes in plurals. (URLs, Smartphones, FAQs, etc.)

**Commas:** We’re an Oxford comma organization. In a set of three items, add the second comma before and/or.

**Company and Product Name:** Always capitalize and punctuate a company or product name exactly as the company does in their own materials.

**Ellipses:** Use sparingly.

**Em Dashes:** We use em dashes (the long ones), not en dashes (also used as hyphens). When breaking up clauses and phrases, use an em dash with no spaces around it. Example: “By applying Soft Skills to your programming career you will advance—I guarantee it.”

**Exclamation Points:** Exclamation points should be used when you are exclaiming something—meaning that you are either speaking to the reader directly or you are VERY excited about a statement. They should also be used sparingly (no more than one for every other paragraph) and only once. (You can relay your emotions about your content like this! But never like this!!!)

**Filenames and Extensions:** Always use the commonly accepted filenames for extensions, even if they are abbreviations. (JPG, GIF, PDF, etc.)—you do not have to spell them out (this is an exception to the acronym rule).

**Numbers:** Spell out cardinal numbers (one through nine) and use numerals for 10 and above. Never start a sentence with a numeral. In titles, use numerals always (even if under 10).

**Periods:** One space after punctuation at the end of a sentence, not two. Our editors will be very feisty if they have to delete spaces throughout an article. So just don’t!

**Truemark Technology:** Always use this capitalization for the site, products, etc.

**Soft Skills:** Always use this capitalization when referring to the book. When referring to the concept of soft skills, use lower-case.

**Spaces after Punctuation:** After all punctuation, primarily periods, there is to be only one space, never two.

**Time:** Use cardinal numbers and am or pm to indicate time. Use “noon” to indicate 12 pm.

**Titles:** Capitalize any word over four letters long (Exception: How To)
