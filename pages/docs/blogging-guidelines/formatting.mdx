## SEO Information

- When your post is loaded into our editing process, you will see a new section at the top of the document requesting information for SEO purposes, including keywords, article synopsis, suggested resources, and notes for the editors/formatter.
- Fill this information in early and thoroughly, as it helps us get your post set up for publishing (and makes sure more people see it!).
- **Points to Focus**
  - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique.
    - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique. 
  - **SEO Title.** The SEO title is the title that is displayed in the search engines. SEO title should be about 50-60 characters long. The title should be unique.
  - **Meta Description.** The meta description provides a short description of a webpage. It also appears on search engine results pages. The meta description should be about 160 characters long and should be able to make users click on it.
  - **Key phrases.** Key phrases are short descriptors that users type into search engines. The optimal length for a key phrase is up to four content words. Key phrase should appear in SEO title, in the meta description, in URL, at the beginning of your content. Keyphrase difficulty should be as low as possible.

## Headers

- Multiple levels of headings and titles can cause confusion by breaking up the structure of a piece in too many directions. Your reader’s attention will be drawn to the different styles rather than the content of your work.
- You should never use more than two levels of heading styles.
- Title style should be used for titles AND headings.
- Heading 1 should only be used if it is the only heading style. It should include a direct keyword or focus phrase that is “the one thing” that a reader should take away.
- Heading 2 & 3 should be used for multi-level structures, and preferably only in pieces that are over 750 words. Heading 2 should be the primary heading style for each section, and Heading 3 should be used as a sub-heading style to the relevant primary heading.

## Bold Font

- Use a bold font for a **strong** emphasis on a word, phrase, or sentence. This is often for something important you want the reader to remember specifically from that section. Like exclamation marks, this will often come across as yelling in your voice, so only use when that is what you are trying to do.

_Italics Font_

- Use an italics font for a _mild_ emphasis on a word, phrase, or sentence. Think of this the same way you speak — if you would speak with a slight inflection to drive a point, italics should be used.

Underline Font

- Since much of the copy and content is delivered digitally, avoid underlines in **all** situations, as they can be confused with hyperlinks in text

~~Strikethrough Font~~

- Should be used sparingly, usually to clarify something that has passed or a thought and/or word that you originally wanted to say, but instead chose something else.

## Lists

Lists make the content skimmable. Unless you are quickly listing items, bullet points and numbered lists should include both the main point and an explanation. Like so:

- **Main Point of the Bullet List:** And an explanation of what this point is exactly, and why it is relevant to either the section or piece as a whole.

Your bullet list should not have paragraph breaks within one bullet point. If your list contains multiple paragraphs, it should instead be formatted into subheadings.

While lists are good for online content, making it easier for readers to take in important points quickly, you should not use more than 2-3 in a piece. Unless it is a long piece with multiple lists of data or reference items.

## Links

- Links to books, resources, etc. should be naturally used throughout your articles.
- When linking to another site, link to an internal page, not the main page. If you are writing about a particular article or topic, link to that. If you are linking to the site in general, link to their About page.
- **Points to Focus**
  - **Inbound Links.** Inbound links are the links that are directed to your webpage from other webpages.
  - **Outbound Links.** Outbound links are the links that are directed to other webpages from your webpage.
