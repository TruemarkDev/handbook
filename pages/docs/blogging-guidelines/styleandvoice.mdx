# Style and Voice
----

While articles are long (at least 1K words, preferably between 2-3K words), they need to be written in a way that is easily scannable for the internet audience.

- Break up long paragraphs into shorter paragraphs. Most should be 3-4 sentences long. There should be lots of white space.
- Use headings between transitions and topics, but avoid general ones like “Introduction” and “Conclusion”.
- Utilize style types like bold, italics, strikethroughs, and block quotes to call attention (but do so sparingly –– our editors will revert to plain-text if it is too much).
- Always defer to good quality writing, but use bullets and lists when applicable to help organize content for ease in reading.

When you are referring to your opinion (or a stated opinion of the site) use I, my, our, etc. When writing to the reader directly, address them as a person, not as an entity, by using you, your, etc. 

Additionally, the voice/tone is vitally important. While we do occasionally dish out tough love on the site, our articles should always inspire and motivate our readers to take action today to improve their lives, both professionally and personally. You should keep these adjectives and phrases in mind when writing your articles:

- Helpful
- Encouraging
- Passionate
- Motivated
- Persistent
- Possibility
- Encouragement
- Community
- Making the complex simple
- Shortcuts to a better future

Finally, posts should avoid unnatural call-to-actions. So, anything that explicitly prompts readers to buy, comment, hire, pay, etc. should be avoided at any part of the post.
