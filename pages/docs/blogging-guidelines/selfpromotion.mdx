# Self-Promotion & Republishing
----

## Self-Promotion

- You may find that in your article it naturally makes sense to link to your own content on your personal websites or the like. Including one or two of these links is fine, as long as, you are not explicitly encouraging readers to buy, share, promote, etc. You will also have a place in your author bio to link to any personal websites or businesses that you may have. Posts will be published with the author as an individual, and not a company. 
- If you arenâ€™t sure if your link is appropriate, just ask! 

## Republishing

- You are free to republish articles after a couple weeks on your own site if you would like to keep the content associated with your own name and work. 
- When doing so, please include an attribution, or a sentence at the end of a post saying "This post originally appeared on ... " with a nofollow link. That helps Google understand that it isn't duplicate content, but a republished piece. 
    - Example: "This post originally appeared on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.xyz.com/myarticleURL">xyz.com</a>"
