# About Truemark Technology

We are remote first, quality focused company that helps entrepreneurs around the world build quality and impactful technology based solutions.

## Our purpose – why we do what we do

We want to instill code quality even in outsourced projects.

In several instances, entrepreneurs have hired freelancers/agencies to get their work done. And have face some of these problems:
1. Poor quality: They didn't account future changes, deliver buggy software or never completed the project.  
2. Freelancers ghosting them and leave projects in unmanageable state(Your project will be very hard to manage if your orginal architect left the sofwtare team without proper handover).

We started Truemark to solve these problems.  
Businesses can work with us at affordable price while we keep on writing world class software for them.

## Our vision – what we want the future to look like

Our vision is to build a remote-first company with a focus on building world-class software.

1. Build world-class software with uncompromising quality; constantly compare, benchmark, and be open to learning from anyone, anywhere to continuously improve and innovate.

2. Cultivate a remote-first service-based company to build great solutions.
