# Our hiring process

We know hiring processes can seem a bit overwhelming at times, but we don’t want you to feel overwhelmed at Truemark. 

We want all candidates – from trainee level to leadership – to have access to the same information and resources (after all we keep our process short and straightforward focusing on actionable and measurable metrics related to the type of work we do).

Truemark’s hiring process is an integral part of our culture. We care deeply about our teams and the people associated within a team. We also do care about building a more representative and inclusive workplace, and that begins with hiring. We believe a fair hiring process is the first step in getting a diversity of perspectives and newer experiences.

With that in mind, we’ve enlisted the descriptive process below, to turn these abstract statements into a concrete map for you to follow as you apply.

## Self-reflection

Once you’ve taken some time to focus on your personal self, you can get a better idea of your traits, goals and aspirations, experiences, interests and behaviours. Your skills and interests are the result of your life experiences, your triumphs, and your failures. Why the visualisation exercise you may ask? To justify your concern, if we hire you based on your skills, we’ll get a skilled employee and there is no doubt in that. But, if we hire you based on your skills, and your enduring passions, and your distinct experiences and perspectives, we’ll get a true Truemarkian. That's what we want.

## Your Resume & Applying Online

It’s intriguing to update your last resume, tweaking it a bit here and there to include your latest work, experiences and references. Once you have your skills and experiences aligned with the job description you can apply to the open positions at [truemark careers](https://www.truemark.dev/careers/#openpositions).
You can also apply to our jobs by sending your resume directly to hr@truemark.com.np but please ensure that your email contents contain a proper subject and an email body to inform us about the position you’ve applied for. 

For instance, a proper email subject could be “Application for the post of Mid-Level ReactJS Developer”, where you can replace the “Mid-Level ReactJS Developer” with the position you are applying for. And the email should also contain a descriptive email body, and a resume and a cover letter as attachments.

## Interview Process

You’ll enter our hiring process once a recruiting team member believes you might be a match for the job position you’ve applied for. While the interview process may differ slightly for different roles or teams, the basics applied are similar whether you’re applying for a tech job or project management, an internship or a leadership position. Not all of these may apply for your role, but here are some of the ways we evaluate candidates in our hiring process:

### The Interview 

We get excited about interviewing and take it seriously because it gives us a perfect opportunity to get to know you over an online video meeting, which is meant to be friendly, warm, and gives you an equal opportunity to get to know us better too. Our code of conduct is guided by our goal of creating an equitable and inclusive experience where candidates from a wide variety of backgrounds have an opportunity to succeed. In the end, we want above all to assess your skills and see if you and this role fit together. So we conduct our interviews using these guiding lights:

* Technical interviewing: Every candidate is assessed based on the technical ability for the role, and we imply the structured interview process for all folks being considered for that role, so that everyone is evaluated from the same perspective, which allows their distinctiveness to emerge.
 
* Open-ended questions: We ask open-ended questions to learn how you solve problems and know about your personality and character in depth. We want to understand how your mind works, how you interact with a team, and what your strengths are.

### Challenge

Once you have passed the interview, we ask you to work on a small project which relates to the position you have applied for. We have dedicated challenges for each open position we advertise.

* Trainee roles: For applicants who have applied for trainee roles, you get five days to complete the assignment.
* Junior roles and above: For applications who have applied for junior and senior roles, you can choose a deadline yourself.

Note: Every applicant has the advantage to work on their assigned challenges from the comfort of their homes.

## Decision and Offer

After you’ve submitted the task before or on the day of the deadline, we’ll bring everything together from your application, interview and the challenge and review it. Yes, we do take into account a number of perspectives to come to a decision so that every interviewing candidate has a fair chance at the position. If we decide that you’re the best candidate for the role, your recruiter will reach out to you with an offer.

Once you’ve accepted the offer, the Truemark onboarding team will walk you through your scope and nature of work, after which you are on your way to becoming a Truemarkian! We’re excited to have you. 

And if you have applied for the trainee position, we would like to inform you a bit about contract and commitments required for the position:

* There will be a binding period of 1 year.
* You’ll be put into a 3 months of training period under a supervisor to monitor your progress on a daily basis.
* Training will be conducted online where you’ll have the comfort of working from home.
* After the successful completion of your training period, you’ll be onboarded to clients or in-house projects.
* We expect you to start working in-person full-time from the office after you’ve been onboarded to a client or in-house project.
