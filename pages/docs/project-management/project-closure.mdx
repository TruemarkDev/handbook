#### Action Items (Developer)
    1. Create comprehensive technical documentation, including project setup, database structure, API details, deployment procedures, and credentials for production, staging, and development environments, as well as project hosting and domain information, tailored to the specific RBAC or ABAC requirements of each project (This documentation contents could vary depending upon the nature and complexity of projects).
    2. Review the existing documentation from the relevant personnel and update it to include any changes or additions.
    3. Decide on the platform for hosting the technical documentation and transfer documentation to the chosen Project Documentation Platform
    4. The decision to choose the platform is taken by the CEO or CTO incase of internal projects and the client incase of client projects.

#### Action Items (Project Manager)
    1. Assess and prioritize project bugs and outstanding tasks, assign responsible team members, set deadlines, and communicate progress to stakeholders to ensure that everyone is aware of the remaining work and any potential impact on project closure.

### Project Closure: Archiving, Access Revocation, Ownership Transfer, and Data Cleanup.
- Archive accounts associated with Project Management Tools and revoke access to people as required.

- Clear calendar events and group emails or email that might not be used (contractors).
- Transfer admin roles on (Project Management Tools, Project Documentation Tools, Online Storage Tools, Chat Communication Tools, Code Collaboration Tools ) associated with the project to senior company owners or clients as per the project need.

#### Action Items
    1. If archiving is necessary:
        - Consult with the project team and stakeholders to confirm their agreement to archive the project.
        - Remove team members who are no longer necessary in Project Management Tools, Project Documentation Tools, Online Storage Tools, Chat Communication Tools, Code Collaboration Tools before archiving.
        - Ensure that the project's data, issues, and related information are securely stored and accessible for future reference.
